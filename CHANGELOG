CHANGELOG
=========

04/12/15
[mesh.cpp] Sphere wireframe finalized.
[matrix.cpp] Undo change to insert(), +z is now out of the page. (This change causes errors with hermite and bezier curves.)
[mesh.cpp] Torus wireframe finalized.

04/09/15
[mesh.cpp] Prism wireframe finalized.
[matrix.cpp] Update insert() so that +z is into the page.

04/08/15
[graphics.cpp] Fixed meshlist such that the list contains a list of the mesh pointers, rather than the actual memory of the meshes themselves.
[graphics.cpp] Engine automatically applies each mesh's stored transformation matrix when exporting to raster.
[graphics.cpp] Engine supports inserting polygons (triangles).

03/26/15
[mesh.cpp] Finalized the code for creating a point sphere. (double for loop using theta and phi, plug into parametric equations (x, y, z) for a sphere.
[mesh.cpp] Finalized the code for creating a point torus. (double for loop using theta and phi, plug into parametric equations (x, y, z) for a torus.
[mesh.cpp] Finalized the code for creating a point cube.

03/25/15 and before: 
[mesh.cpp]
[graphics.cpp]
[loader.cpp]
[matrix.cpp]
[raster.cpp]
